# Dice Game
This with created with the udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann

A 2 player dice game, where the goal is to bank up to 20 points before your opponent.

This can be previewed here usinh htmlpreview:

Roll the dice.
If the dice returns a 2-6, this will add to your current score, and you get to roll again.
Roll a 1, and you lose your current score and your turn, and player 2 takes their turn.

You can bank your current score by pressing "HOLD" and forfeiting your turn. 
This moves your current score to the Banked Main score.

The first to bank 20 points wins!


When building this app I found a little bug, which wasn't addressed in the course: 
//BUG Pressing hold when current score = 0 errors in console.

I aim to come back and tie this loose end up as soon as possible
